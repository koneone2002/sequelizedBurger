# burger
This assignment involved creating a burger application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
My SQL and Node were used to query and route data in the application and Handlebars was used to generate HTML.

The burger application is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers that they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side --- the burger is waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour It! button, which when clicked, moves the burger to the right side of the page.

The app stores each burger in the database, whether the state is devoured or not.


Feel free to create your favorite burger!
